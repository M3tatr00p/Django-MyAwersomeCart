The only difference it has with a brick and mortar store is that here, the entire process takes place online.The journey of an eCommerce firm begins with setting up an eCommerce website. It is usually done with plugins like WooCommerce. After that, the products are displayed along with necessary details like product descriptions and price tags. A CTA button like “Buy Now” is placed near the products for the convenience of the customers. If they feel like buying a product they can simply click on the button and make the payment.Customers are usually asked to place their orders by filling up a form. There, they need to provide all the necessary details like the delivery address. There are different paymnt methods used in the eCommerce industry. Buyers either can make the payment through a payment gateway like PayPal or they can use their credit cards. There is another option called COD or cash on delivery. This is mainly preferred by senior customers. In this option, the buyer makes the payment when the item they ordered is delivered on their personal address. The payment can be made either in cash or through cards or other convenient options like Google Pay.If you are not happy with the quality of the product or mistakenly a different product gets delivered to you, you can use the reverse logistics system.
